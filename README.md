# humiditySensorSimulator
Simple Python code to simulate humidity sensors array scattered across a given area, under different soil conditions. In this version all the conditions are still hardcoded, but randon under a certain range. Humidity simulation (main file) also simulates human and natural watering events.

This version outputs the data into CSV format to the `/output` folder.
